2011-02-16 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.9 released

* Extracted the ZX80 programs and appended .o extensions.
* Modified the colour scheme and the logo.
* Updated "Some Very Useful Links".

2009-11-23 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.8 released
* Changed ~~~~~ to ~~ in appendix five to help keep
  everything aligned when the page is shrunk/zoomed out.
* Finished DISASM.

2009-11-04 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.7 released
* Added two more dump types to sif-dump.p
* Updated the disassembler algorithm 1 in chapter 16 and
  listed its main deficiency and offered ideas on fixing it.
* This is only a minor release but I want to get it out as
  I'm now going to spend some time finishing DISASM.

2009-10-29 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.6 released
* Integrated LENSLIST2 and DUMP into HEXLD3E.
* Added an HEXLD3E page with BASIC listing (m/c is elsewhere).
* Removed sif-dump.p as it's now part of HEXLD3E.
* Standalone sif-dumpalt.p is now sif-dump.p.
* Reordered the pages Beyond the Book.

2009-10-27 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.5 released
* Reorganised the latter part of the book so that there is a
  clear distinction between the end of Toni's work and the
  beginning of my additional work. If I was only adding little
  bits it wouldn't matter, but I'm adding huge programs such as
  the disassembler and these programs need their own pages and
  won't all fit in one appendix.
* farewell moved to its correct place after appendix06.
* appendix08 has become downloads.
* Beyond the Book:
* Renamed misc-*.p to sif-*.p
* appendix07 has become sif-lenslist2.
* Added sif-dump.html, sif-dump.p and sif-dumpalt.p.
* Added sif-disasm.html.
* Added some non-breaking spaces in downloads.html where the text
  begins with words smaller than This so that small screens don't
  leave I and A to the right of screenshots.
* Modified the logo a little.
* Updated COPYING.txt.

2009-10-26 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.4 released
* Added HEXLD3E, a version of HEXLD3D that's been relocated to
  6400h; my current base program for the chapter 16 disassembler
  and beyond.
* Added some comments to the chapter 16 disassembler algorithm to
  make it clearer. Also updated the initial part to validate
  prefixes.
* Added DUMP and DUMPALT, a simple little program that dumps
  memory using two different formats: hex or Sinclair character
  codes, but very useful and very fast.

2009-10-19 Thunor <thunorsif (at) hotmail.com>
* 0.1.3 released
* Cleared up some ambiguities regarding HEXLD3 and HEXLD3D.
* Changed all of the "thunor.org.uk"s within the banners to
  MMCoYZX81 as they were overkill and a result of my copying
  and pasting to create new pages. The URLs still work though.
* Modified my foreword slightly.
* Added an icon next to all external links which appears as
  "(->)" in text browsers.
* Identified to the reader the place holders used within the
  disassembler algorithm in chapter 16.
* Appended the ISBN number to the book's title in Contents.

  when JavaScript is disabled to maximise screen width.

* For the offline version: removed all web icons.
* Modified the licence covering my own source code in appendix seven.
* Created a new logo that's displayed in the banner.
* The offline version package is now located in appendix 8 and is
  linked to from the contents.
* Added WOS/RWAP forum links in forewordthunor.html.
